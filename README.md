lab06 - Sorting Algorithms

Write a program that creates three identical arrays, list1, list2, and list3. Each has 5000 elements. The program should fill list1 with random numbers ( use a call by value function) and then should copy the contents of the list1 into each of the other lists ( use a call by value function ). The program then:
a. sorts list1 using bubble sort
b. sorts list2 using selection sort
c. sorts list3 using insertion sort

The program then outputs the number of comparisons and item assignments made by each sort algorithm for a comparison of sorting algoritms.

Your output should look something like:

comparisons assignments
bubble sort: 12497500    18812490
selection sort: 12497500 29994
insertion sort: 6275817   6280818
